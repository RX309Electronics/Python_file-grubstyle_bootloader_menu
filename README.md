This software is free and unlicensed but i would still like it and it would be kind of you if you put some credit of me the creator When you distribute the software to the internet, like making a video about it. I will be happy when you put either the link to my github or my project in the description or put "Made by: 309Electronics" in the description. I am just a hobbyist and would like to get a bit more attention from the general public so if you could, please credit me, it would help me a lot and would make my motivation not fade away. 

About The Creator 309Electronics: 309Electronics is a self educated electronics enthuisiast, thinkerer, engineer, reverse engineer, programmer, repair guy and project creator. I live in the Netherlands in Eindhoven in a small village called 'acht' I am a highschool student Who likes electronics and coding. i am pretty proud of my work! Please dont expect amazing quality or criticise some things i do or neat code because my motto is "If it works dont touch it" and i am just a hobbyist and not a profesional. Although i am open for any improvements or tips if you can provide them feel free to do so, i like to learn new ways and things. If there are any problems, bugs or you can provide tips please email me to 309Projectscustomerline@gmail.com (long email adres, i know!). Please know that apart from coding and doing the things i like, i also am still a student and have school 5 days in the week + homework to do so i might not always check the customer line/have time to do so. Please be patient and i will always react with a thank you mail or a "got it". I hope you like this project and feel free to scroll through my github page full of (dumb) projects. :)
